## 🔧 Integration Required

The service is **ready to use** but needs to be integrated into your controllers. Follow the integration guide in `ACCOUNTING_SERVICE_GUIDE.md`.

### Quick Integration Steps:

#### 1. PurchaseOrderController
```php
protected $accountingService;

public function __construct(AccountingService $accountingService)
{
    $this->accountingService = $accountingService;
}

// In store() - after creating PO
$this->accountingService->recordPurchaseOrderCreated(
    $purchaseOrder->id,
    $total,
    $request->dt
);

// In update() - when status changes to 'completed'
if ($oldStatus !== 'completed' && $newStatus === 'completed') {
    $this->accountingService->recordGoodsReceived($purchaseOrder->id, $total, $request->dt);
    $this->accountingService->recordSupplierPayment($purchaseOrder->id, $total, $request->dt);
}
```

#### 2. ProductionController (if exists)
```php
// In store() - after creating production
$this->accountingService->recordProductionProcess(
    $production->id,
    $amount,
    $request->date
);
```

#### 3. OrderController
```php
// In store() - after creating order
$this->accountingService->recordSalesOrder(
    $order->id,
    $total,
    $request->dt
);
```

#### 4. InvoiceController
```php
// In store() - after creating invoice
$taxAmount = $subtotal * 0.11; // 11% PPN
$this->accountingService->recordInvoiceSent(
    $invoice->id,
    $subtotal,
    $taxAmount,
    $request->dt
);
```

#### 5. PaymentController
```php
// In store() - after creating payment
$taxAmount = $totalAmount * 0.11 / 1.11;
$this->accountingService->recordCustomerPayment(
    $payment->id,
    $totalAmount,
    $taxAmount,
    $request->dt
);
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Integrate into Controllers** - Follow the examples in `ACCOUNTING_SERVICE_GUIDE.md`
2. **Test Each Integration** - Create test transactions and verify journal entries

## 🔍 Verification

To verify journal entries for any transaction:

```php
use App\Models\JournalEntry;

$entries = JournalEntry::where('transaction_id', $id)
    ->where('transaction_name', 'PurchaseOrder')
    ->with('account')
    ->get();

foreach ($entries as $entry) {
    echo "{$entry->account->name}: ";
    echo "Dr {$entry->debit} Cr {$entry->credit}\n";
}
```
