## Test Data Seeded

### Suppliers (3 records)
1. **PT Beton Indonesia** (081234567890)
   - Materials: Besi Beton 10mm, Ready Mix K-250, Semen Portland 50kg
   
2. **CV Kayu Jati Makmur** (081298765432)
   - Materials: Kayu Meranti 4x6, Triplek 9mm, Pipa PVC 4 inch
   
3. **Toko Bangunan Sumber Rejeki** (081387654321)
   - Materials: Pasir Cor per m³, Batu Split per m³, Cat Tembok Avian 5kg, Genteng Keramik

### Materials (10 records)
Various construction materials with realistic Indonesian pricing and stock quantities.

## Important Notes

### Database Schema Consideration
⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The existing `materials` table in the database has `supplier_id` as **NOT NULL**. This differs from the user's original requirement which stated materials should only show in the supplier multi-select if `supplier_id IS NULL`.

**Adaptation Made:**
- Since the existing schema doesn't allow null supplier_id, all materials must be assigned to a supplier
- The multi-select on supplier forms now shows ALL materials (they can be reassigned between suppliers)
- Delete supplier logic prevents deletion if materials are assigned (to maintain data integrity)
- This is noted in controller comments for future reference

### Column Naming
⚠️ The materials table uses `qty` for stock quantity, not `stock`. All code has been updated accordingly.

  - [ ] Click Materials - verify opens with emerald active state
  - [ ] Click Suppliers - verify opens with emerald active state
  - [ ] Verify Master Data menu stays open when on materials or suppliers pages

## Known Limitations

1. **Supplier ID Requirement**: Due to existing database schema, materials must always have a supplier assigned. The original requirement for showing only unassigned materials (supplier_id IS NULL) cannot be implemented without modifying the database schema to allow null values.

2. **Material Stock Management**: Stock (qty) is not editable through the Materials CRUD interface - it's shown as read-only. Stock management would typically be handled through purchase order or inventory modules.

3. **Supplier Deletion**: Suppliers cannot be deleted if they have materials assigned. Materials must be reassigned first to maintain referential integrity.

## Server Information

**Development Server Running:**
- URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:
- [ ] Review database schema and decide if supplier_id should allow NULL
- [ ] Run migrations on production: `php artisan migrate`
- [ ] Optionally run seeder: `php artisan db:seed --class=MaterialSupplierSeeder`
- [ ] Clear cache: `php artisan config:clear && php artisan cache:clear`
- [ ] Test all functionality in production environment
- [ ] Verify export file permissions
- [ ] Check CDN resources (Choices.js) are accessible
