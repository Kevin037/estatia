# Payment Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive Payment CRUD feature with automatic stock management, conditional bank fields, and PDF export functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database
- **Table**: `payments`
- **Fields**: 
  - `id` - Primary key
  - `no` - Payment number (PAY-XXXXXX format)
  - `invoice_id` - Foreign key to invoices
  - `dt` - Payment date (already existed)
  - `amount` - Payment amount
  - `payment_type` - Payment method (cash/transfer)
  - `bank_account_id` - Account number (for transfer)
  - `bank_account_type` - Bank name (for transfer)
  - `bank_account_name` - Account holder name (for transfer)
  - `paid_at` - Timestamp when paid (auto-filled)
  - `timestamps` - Created/updated timestamps

### 2. Model (app/Models/Payment.php)
- **Relationships**:
  - `belongsTo(Invoice::class)` - Links to invoice
- **Features**:
  - Date casting for `dt` field
  - DateTime casting for `paid_at`
  - Static method `generateNumber()` for auto payment numbers (PAY-000001 format)

### 3. Controller (app/Http/Controllers/PaymentController.php)
**CRUD Operations**:
- `index()` - DataTables list with 7 columns
- `create()` - Form with unpaid invoices
- `store()` - Create payment with validation, stock reduction, auto paid_at
- `show()` - Display payment details with all relationships
- `edit()` - Edit form with pre-populated data
- `update()` - Update payment with validation
- `destroy()` - Delete payment with stock restoration

**Special Methods**:
- `getInvoiceDetails()` - Ajax endpoint for invoice data with payment summary
- `exportPdf()` - Generate payment receipt PDF

**Business Logic**:
1. **Stock Reduction** (on payment create):
   ```php
   $product = $order->unit->product;
   $product->decrement('qty', 1);
   ```

2. **Stock Restoration** (on payment delete):
   ```php
   $product = $order->unit->product;
   $product->increment('qty', 1);
   ```

3. **Conditional Validation** (bank fields required for transfer):
   ```php
   if ($request->payment_type === 'transfer') {
       $rules['bank_account_id'] = 'required|string|max:255';
       $rules['bank_account_type'] = 'required|string|max:255';
       $rules['bank_account_name'] = 'required|string|max:255';
   }
   ```

4. **Auto-fill paid_at**:
   ```php
   $validated['paid_at'] = now();
   ```

5. **Payment Number Generation**:
   ```php
   $validated['no'] = Payment::generateNumber();
   ```
