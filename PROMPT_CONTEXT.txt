- Auth complete (register, login, forgot password, verify email)
- Exports: Excel (maatwebsite/excel) + PDF (dompdf)
- Seeders & Factories for demo data
- Responsiveness + basic a11y
- Modern UI on entire project
- On File field while file is uploaded, a preview of the file will be displayed immediately & realtime.
- Dropdown menus are given proportional SVG icons.
- Selecting a menu item also opens its dropdown group.
- Ensure element shown by proper margin & padding soo look tidy.
- Use modern sweet alerts (confirm dialogs), don't use the built-in JavaScript. Ensure showing alert according to result (error / success)
- Maximize Tailwind's use to enhance the overall project UI.
- Use select2 for select option fields.
- Use rupiah currency for this project about anything related with money/price
- Don't use constrained and onDelete cascade on migration, since sometimes data can have feorign key and nullable
