# Payment Feature - Quick Testing Guide

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Column 'total_paid' doesn't exist in database
**Solution**: Changed from SQL query filtering to collection filtering in `create()` and `edit()` methods

- `PaymentController::create()` - Now loads all invoices and filters in-memory

## 🔍 Database Verification Queries

### Check Payment Creation
```sql
SELECT * FROM payments ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### Check Product Stock Changes
```sql
SELECT p.id, p.name, p.qty, u.id as unit_id, o.id as order_id
FROM products p
JOIN units u ON u.product_id = p.id
JOIN orders o ON o.unit_id = u.id
WHERE o.id = [your_order_id];
```

### Check Invoice Payment Status
```sql
SELECT 
    i.id,
    i.no as invoice_no,
    o.total as order_total,
    SUM(p.amount) as total_paid,
    (o.total - COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0)) as remaining
FROM invoices i
JOIN orders o ON o.id = i.order_id
LEFT JOIN payments p ON p.invoice_id = i.id
WHERE i.id = [your_invoice_id]
GROUP BY i.id, i.no, o.total;
```

### Check Payment with Bank Details
```sql
SELECT 
    no,
    payment_type,
    amount,
    bank_account_id,
    bank_account_type,
    bank_account_name
FROM payments
WHERE payment_type = 'transfer'
ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;
```

## ⚠️ Common Issues to Check

### Issue: "No invoices available"
**Cause**: All invoices are fully paid or no invoices exist
**Solution**: Create new order and invoice with pending balance

### Issue: Bank fields validation fails
**Cause**: JavaScript not toggling required attribute
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, verify jQuery loaded

### Issue: Stock not decreasing
**Cause**: Product relationship not properly set
**Solution**: Verify Order → Unit → Product chain exists

### Issue: Ajax invoice details not loading
**Cause**: Route not accessible or data missing
**Solution**: Check route `payments.invoice-details` and verify relationships

### Issue: PDF export fails
**Cause**: DomPDF not properly configured
**Solution**: Check vendor/autoload.php includes Barryvdh package
