## Need Help?

### Check for Errors
```bash
# View all lands routes
php artisan route:list --name=lands

# Check how many lands exist
php artisan tinker --execute="echo App\Models\Land::count();"

# Re-seed data if needed
php artisan db:seed --class=LandSeeder
```

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Page not found" when accessing /lands
- **Fix:** Ensure routes are registered in `routes/web.php`
- **Verify:** Run `php artisan route:list --name=lands`

**Issue:** No data appears in table
- **Fix:** Seed the database
- **Command:** `php artisan db:seed --class=LandSeeder`

**Issue:** Dimensions don't show decimal places
- **Check:** DataTables should format as "50.00 m" not "50 m"
- **Verify:** Model casts are set to `decimal:2`

**Issue:** Photo upload fails
- **Fix:** Ensure storage link exists
- **Command:** `php artisan storage:link`
- **Verify:** `public/storage` symlink points to `storage/app/public`

**Issue:** Photo not displaying
- **Check:** File exists in `storage/app/public/lands/`
- **Verify:** Asset URL is correct: `asset('storage/' . $land->photo)`

## Features Comparison

### Lands vs Users
Both features follow the same pattern but Lands has:
- ✅ **More Form Fields:** Name, Address, Width, Length, Location, Description, Photo
- ✅ **Decimal Fields:** Width and length (2 decimal precision)
- ✅ **Unit Display:** Dimensions shown as "XX.XX m"
- ✅ **Number Inputs:** Special input type for decimal entry
- ✅ **Textarea Fields:** Address, Location, Description
- ✅ **Photo Upload:** Same as Users (JPEG, PNG, max 2MB)
- ✅ **Validation:** Prevents negative dimensions

---

## Pattern Compliance ✅

The Lands feature matches the Users module exactly:
- Same layout and styling
- Same button colors and positions
- Same DataTables configuration
- Same form structure
- Same validation approach
- Same loading states
- Same photo upload handling
