## Need Help?

### Check for Errors
```bash
# View all milestones routes
php artisan route:list --name=milestones

# Check how many milestones exist
php artisan tinker --execute="echo App\Models\Milestone::count();"

# Re-seed data if needed
php artisan db:seed --class=MilestoneSeeder
```

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Page not found" when accessing /milestones
- **Fix:** Ensure routes are registered in `routes/web.php`
- **Verify:** Run `php artisan route:list --name=milestones`

**Issue:** No data appears in table
- **Fix:** Seed the database
- **Command:** `php artisan db:seed --class=MilestoneSeeder`

**Issue:** Validation error on create
- **Check:** Name is required, description is optional
- **Tip:** You can create a milestone with just a name

**Issue:** Description cut off in table
- **Not a bug:** Descriptions are intentionally truncated to 100 characters in the list view for better readability
- **See full text:** Click "Edit" to view complete description

**Issue:** Search not working
- **Check:** DataTables should search both name and description fields
- **Verify:** Type in search box and press Enter
