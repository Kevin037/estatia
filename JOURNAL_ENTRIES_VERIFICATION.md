## 📝 Detailed Breakdown by Transaction Type

### 1. Order Transactions
**Total Entries**: 40 (20 debit/credit pairs)

**Accounting Logic**:
- **Debit**: Piutang (Accounts Receivable - Code 102xxx)
- **Credit**: Pendapatan (Revenue - Code 401xxx)

**Purpose**: Records property sales revenue when orders are completed

**Example Entry**:
```
Transaction: Order #ORD-123456
Debit:  Piutang Usaha      Rp 1,500,000,000  (Asset increases)
Credit: Pendapatan Penjualan Rp 1,500,000,000  (Revenue increases)
```

**20 Order Transactions Recorded**:
- Each order creates 2 journal entries (1 debit + 1 credit)
- Represents property sales transactions
- Amount equals unit price from order

---

### 2. Payment Transactions
**Total Entries**: 40 (20 debit/credit pairs)

**Accounting Logic**:
- **Debit**: Kas (Cash - Code 101xxx)
- **Credit**: Piutang (Accounts Receivable - Code 102xxx)

**Purpose**: Records cash received from customers, reducing accounts receivable

**Example Entry**:
```
Transaction: Payment #PAY-123456
Debit:  Kas di Bank        Rp 500,000,000  (Cash increases)
Credit: Piutang Usaha      Rp 500,000,000  (Receivable decreases)
```

**20 Payment Transactions Recorded**:
- Each payment creates 2 journal entries (1 debit + 1 credit)
- Represents cash collection from invoices
- Amount from actual payment records

### 3. PurchaseOrder Transactions
**Total Entries**: 16 (8 debit/credit pairs)

**Accounting Logic**:
- **Debit**: Persediaan/Biaya (Inventory/Expense - Code 103xxx/501xxx)
- **Credit**: Utang (Accounts Payable - Code 201xxx)

**Purpose**: Records material purchases for construction

**Example Entry**:
```
Transaction: PurchaseOrder #PO-000001

Credit: Utang Usaha        Rp 250,000,000  (Payable increases)
```

**8 PurchaseOrder Transactions Recorded**:
- Each PO creates 2 journal entries (1 debit + 1 credit)
- Represents material/service purchases
- 8 POs available from PurchaseOrderSeeder

## 🔍 Data Integrity Checks

### ✅ Paired Entries
Every journal entry has a corresponding pair:
- Each debit entry has a matching credit entry
- Linked via `journal_entry_id` field
- Ensures double-entry bookkeeping compliance

### ✅ Transaction References
All journal entries reference actual transactions:
- **Order entries**: Reference existing Order IDs
- **Payment entries**: Reference existing Payment IDs
- **PurchaseOrder entries**: Reference existing PurchaseOrder IDs

### ✅ Amount Accuracy
Journal entry amounts match transaction amounts:
- Order entries = Order total price
- Payment entries = Payment amount
- PurchaseOrder entries = PO total amount

### ✅ Account Selection
All accounts used are leaf accounts (have parent_id):
- Code 101xxx: Kas (Cash accounts)
- Code 102xxx: Piutang (Receivables)
- Code 103xxx: Persediaan (Inventory)
- Code 201xxx: Utang (Payables)
- Code 401xxx: Pendapatan (Revenue)
- Code 501xxx: Biaya (Expenses)

## 🎯 Accounting Principles Verified

### 1. Double-Entry Bookkeeping ✅
Every transaction affects at least two accounts:
- One debit, one credit
- Total debits = Total credits

### 2. Accounting Equation ✅
Assets = Liabilities + Equity + Revenue - Expenses

**Verified**:
- Cash increases (debit) = Receivables decrease (credit)
- Receivables increase (debit) = Revenue increase (credit)
- Inventory increase (debit) = Payables increase (credit)

### 3. Transaction Flow ✅
```
Order → Piutang ↑ / Pendapatan ↑
  ↓
Invoice Created
  ↓
Payment → Kas ↑ / Piutang ↓
```

### 4. Balance Sheet Impact ✅
```
Assets Side:
- Kas increases with payments (debit)
- Piutang increases with orders (debit)
- Piutang decreases with payments (credit)

Liabilities Side:
- Utang increases with purchases (credit)

Revenue:
- Pendapatan increases with orders (credit)
```

## 🧪 Testing Queries

### Verify Total Balance
```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(debit) as total_debit,
    SUM(credit) as total_credit,
    SUM(debit) - SUM(credit) as difference
FROM journal_entries;
```

**Expected Result**: difference = 0.00

### Check Paired Entries
```sql
SELECT 
    j1.id as entry_1,
    j2.id as entry_2,
    j1.debit as debit_amount,
    j2.credit as credit_amount,
    j1.transaction_name
FROM journal_entries j1
JOIN journal_entries j2 ON j1.journal_entry_id = j2.id
WHERE j1.debit > 0 AND j2.credit > 0
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected Result**: debit_amount = credit_amount for each pair

### Count by Transaction Type
```sql
SELECT 
    transaction_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_entries,
    COUNT(*) / 2 as pairs,
    SUM(debit) as total_debit,
    SUM(credit) as total_credit
FROM journal_entries
GROUP BY transaction_name;
```
