## 💰 Accounting Verification

### Balance Check
```
Total Debit:  Rp 34,816,995,811.00
Total Credit: Rp 34,816,995,811.00
Difference:   Rp 0.00
```

### ✅ PERFECTLY BALANCED!

All journal entries are properly paired:
- Every debit entry has a corresponding credit entry
- Total debit = Total credit
- Accounting equation maintained

### Journal Entry Distribution

  - Debit: Piutang (Accounts Receivable)
  - Credit: Pendapatan (Revenue)
  
- **Payment Transactions**: 40 entries (20 debit + 20 credit pairs)
  - Debit: Kas (Cash)

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Smart Relationship Handling
OrderFactory automatically cascades relationships:
```php
$unit = Unit::inRandomOrder()->first();
'project_id' => $unit->cluster->project_id,  // Auto-assigned
'cluster_id' => $unit->cluster_id,            // Auto-assigned
'total' => $unit->price,                      // Auto-assigned
```

### 2. Intelligent Payment Calculation
PaymentFactory respects invoice balance:
```php
$orderTotal = $invoice->order->total;
$existingPayments = $invoice->payments()->sum('amount');
$remaining = $orderTotal - $existingPayments;
// 70% chance full payment, 30% partial
```

### 3. Balanced Accounting
JournalEntryFactory ensures accounting integrity:
- Every entry is paired (debit + credit)
- Journal entries linked via `journal_entry_id`
- Proper account selection from chart of accounts
- Transaction amounts match actual order/payment/PO totals

### 4. Realistic Indonesian Data
- Phone: 08##-####-#### format
- Currency: Indonesian Rupiah (IDR)
- Property prices: Rp 300,000,000 - Rp 2,000,000,000
- Banks: BCA, Mandiri, BNI, BRI, CIMB Niaga, Permata, OCBC NISP
- Cluster names: Asri, Bahagia, Cendana, Melati, etc.

## 🔧 Usage

### Fresh Database Seeding
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### Reseed Without Migration
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

### Run Specific Seeder
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=AccountSeeder
```

### Verify Accounting Balance
```bash
php artisan tinker
```
Then run:
```php
echo number_format(\App\Models\JournalEntry::sum('debit'), 2);
echo number_format(\App\Models\JournalEntry::sum('credit'), 2);
```

## 📝 Notes

1. **Dependency Order**: DatabaseSeeder handles proper seeding order automatically
2. **Unique Constraints**: Unit `no` field limited to 999 units per session
3. **Status Logic**: Invoice status auto-updated after payments created
4. **Polymorphic Relations**: Journal entries support multiple transaction types
5. **Chart of Accounts**: Hierarchical 9-digit structure (100000000, 101000000, etc.)
